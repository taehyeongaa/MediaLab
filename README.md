# MediaLab
Welcome to my github.


This sources -> files are real time video objects detection.
This project uses the visual Studio 2015 and version 3.1 version.(Images and images are attached.)


Because it is not intended for commercial use, it was created using SURF detector using opencv.

In addition, I compared SIFT and SURF.
The results of the SIFT and SURF were able to confirm that the SIFT was quicker, but the number of matching points was confirmed by SURF.


Since each of the pros and cons has existed, it would be better to use them for their own projects.I don't want anything bad to do,
and I guess I'll have to use it for each occasion.

Became interesting experience
